I am a Ph.D student at Virginia Tech (Fall 2022-Present). I'm working under the supervision of [Dr. Alireza Shojaei](https://mlsoc.vt.edu/about/faculty-and-staff/alireza-shojaei.html) at Myers-Lawson School of Construction.

Originally from Siem Reap, Cambodia, I received a B.E in Civil Engineering from Zhejiang University, China. In the last 2 years of my bachelorâ€™s program, I have been working as an undergraduate research assistant on the application of Deep Learning for crack detection in buildings.

I'm currently working on different research projects including Smart buildings, as well as the application of Blockchain Technology, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations,  Digital Twin,  Augmented Reality, Machine Learning and Large Language Models (LLM) in construction industry. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time playing soccer and video games.
