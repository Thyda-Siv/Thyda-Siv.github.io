I'm a Ph.D student in the Environmental Design and Planning program (EDP) at Virginia Tech's Myers-Lawson School of Construction (Fall 2022-Present). I'm working under the supervision of [Dr. Alireza Shojaei](https://mlsoc.vt.edu/about/faculty-and-staff/alireza-shojaei.html) and I am also grateful to be advised by [Dr. Xinghua Gao]([https://mlsoc.vt.edu/about/faculty-and-staff/alireza-shojaei.html](https://mlsoc.vt.edu/about/faculty-and-staff/xinghua-gao.html)), [Dr. Abiola Akanmu](https://www.webapps.cee.vt.edu/index.php?category=people&pagetype=bio&do=getprofile&user=akanmu.html) and [Dr. Philip Agee]([https://mlsoc.vt.edu/about/faculty-and-staff/alireza-shojaei.html](https://mlsoc.vt.edu/about/faculty-and-staff/philip-agee.html))

Prior to Virginia Tech, I received a B.E in Civil Engineering from Zhejiang University where I've spent the last two of the program working as an undergraduate research assistant on the application of Deep Learning for structural health monitoring.

I'm currently working on different research projects including Smart buildings, as well as the application of Blockchain Technology, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations,  Digital Twin,  Augmented Reality, Machine Learning and Large Language Models (LLM) in construction industry. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time playing soccer and video games.
