I'm a Ph.D student in the Environmental Design and Planning program (EDP) at Virginia Tech's Myers-Lawson School of Construction (Fall 2022-Present). I'm working under the supervision of Dr. Alireza Shojaei and I am also grateful to be advised by Dr. Xinghua Gao, Dr. Abiola Akanmu, and Dr. Philip Agee

Prior to Virginia Tech, I received a B.E in Civil Engineering from Zhejiang University where I've spent the last two of the program working as an undergraduate research assistant on the application of Deep Learning for structural health monitoring.

My dissertation research explores the application of blockchain and decentralized governance in smart building facilities management. I also work on different research projects including Smart buildings, as well as the application of Blockchain Technology, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations,  Digital Twin,  Augmented Reality, Machine Learning, and Large Language Models (LLM) in the construction industry. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time playing soccer and video games.
