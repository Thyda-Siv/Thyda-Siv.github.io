The project presents a unique challenge: constructing two buildings with vastly different intended lifespans. The office building for DP is designed for a 5-year maximum lifespan, while the Data Centre will serve for over 25 years.
For sustainability and efficiency, both buildings utilize a modular 7.6 x 7.6-meter grid system, significantly reducing construction time and costs. Between these structures, there's a partially covered social space that connects the buildings while promoting creativity and collaboration. This green, open environment not only enhances communication between teams but also provides DP staff with a healthier, more inspiring workplace.
