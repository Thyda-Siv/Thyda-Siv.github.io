The project presents a unique challenge: constructing two buildings with vastly different intended lifespans. The office building for DP is designed for a 5-year maximum lifespan, while the Data Centre will serve for over 25 years.
For sustainability and efficiency, both buildings utilize a modular 7.6 x 7.6-meter grid system, significantly reducing construction time and costs. Between these structures, there's a partially covered social space that connects the buildings while promoting creativity and collaboration. This green, open environment not only enhances communication between teams but also provides DP staff with a healthier, more inspiring workplace.

This master planning takes inspiration from the region's rugged terrain and uneven topography formed by mountains and rivers, the site allowed for varied and exciting spatial arrangements for this local market. Paths, like rivers, carve through the building creating a natural flow of movement and connection. The grid system establishes a flexible framework where users can navigate freely throughout the plan, mimicking the organic way people might traverse a natural landscape.

The plan integrates abundant greenery with modular architecture, creating a marketplace where nature and commerce intertwine at multiple levels. The design seeks to balance structured organization with organic flow, establishing interconnected courtyards and plazas beneath extensive green roofs that transform the market into a vibrant urban oasis.
